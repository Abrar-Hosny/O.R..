            Steps
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). 
                    Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. 
                    As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, 
                    stirring continuously for about 1 minute.
                </li>
                <li>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot.
                     Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. 
                     Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes.
                      As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly (see notes for suggestions).</li>
